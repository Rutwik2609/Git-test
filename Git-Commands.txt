Git - There are 3 stages 
 
1.Working directory : place where projest resides.
2.Staging area      : code which is finalized and tracked.
3.Commit            : Save the code


-- git status : To check status and track files.
-- git init   : To intialize working repo.
-- git add "fileName"  : To add specific file to staging area.
-- git add .  : For all files.
-- git branch : To check branch name.
-- git commit —m “custom message” :To commit changes.
-- git brach branch_name : To create branch
-- git remote add origin "github-repo-link": To connect to github repo.
-- git checkout branch_name : To change branch
-- 
-- git remote -v :To chechk github repo


The upstream branch name on local and github repo needs to be matched.

Suppose i want to Collborate with other user repo so follow this steps:
git clone repo -----
git branch create_branch
git checkout created_branch
Make changes
stage and commit
git push origin Created_branch 

D3 Starts :

on main user main branch add this commands to fetch new updates- 
1. git fetch origin main/master
2. git pull origin main/master 

After making changes in your branch the repo owner needs to pull & merge


git starts: 

git branch -d branchname : Deletes branch if merge is done sucessfully
git branch -D branchname : Force delete despite if merged or not
git log :To check actions

d1 starts : 

To make logs easy to read:
1. git log --pretty=oneline
2. git log --graph
To quit type q

Suppose i have incomplete file and emergency changes to be done in index.html so i can use git stash
 git add and commit complete files
 git stash -u :To stop tracking of unstaged file 
 git stash pop:To work again on incomplete file
 (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
